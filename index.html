    <h1>My name is Bryce Huddleston</h1>
    <p>I am working on getting a degree in business. I love watching the Carolina Hurricanes whenever they play. I am also a big Dodgers baseball fan. My favorite player from the Carolina Hurricanes would have to be either Sebastian Aho or Seth Jarvis. My favorite players on the Dodgers are Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts.</p>
