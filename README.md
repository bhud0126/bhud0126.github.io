2. My GitHub account is something I will be using for this class to upload files for this class for assignments and make repositories for my assignments.
3. I created this repository for my Web, Programming, & Database Foundation class.
4. In order to clone the repository onto my local machine, I logged into GitHub Desktop and clicked Clone A Repository. Then I chose the repository I wanted to clone. Then I selected where I wanted to clone it to, which is the GitHub Cloned Repository folder on my desktop.
